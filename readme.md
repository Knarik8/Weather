The task took approximately 2-3 hours to complete, including troubleshooting.

Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?
The initial setup code was not ready to run. I had some exceptions related to libs like
Javax persistence instead of Jakarta. And also minor changes were needed for dependency versions.
Minor adjustments were needed, such as:
Adding the actual API key for the weather service.
Ensuring the database configuration matched the local environment.
Fixing minor issues in entity relationships and handling JSON responses.

Breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps and asking for specific code snippets for each part.
Prompting for specific annotations and dependency versions for Spring Boot setup.
